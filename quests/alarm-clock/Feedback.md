Ellen: this is an excellent solution. Please continue with this level of quality. It is very nice work.

Re the video, a couple suggestions:
  - Showing screens of code is not a best practice. Better to sketch out the program flow and show manjor blocks and functions
  - Consider using a tripod (we have some on the cart). This elimiates the shake
